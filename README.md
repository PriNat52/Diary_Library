### Installation

Our application is modular and broken into 3 components: `api` as the Express backend, `database` for connecting to the MongoDB Cloud, and `client` for our front-end React application. Please see the respective component directories for help running each component individually.

**NOTE:** The `database` component is driven by the Express Server. You should only need to start the Express Server in `api` and the React front end in `client` to demo the application. Make sure your run `npm install` in all components directories (`api`, `client`, and `database`) if this is your first time cloning the application.
